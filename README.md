<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/r3nt0n/bopscrk/blob/master/img/bopscrk-2.4.5.gif" /></p>  



+ **Targeted-attack wordlist creator**: introduce personal info related to target, combines every word and transforms results into possible passwords. The *lyricpass* module allows to **search lyrics related to artists** and include them to the wordlists.
+ **Customizable case** and **leet transforms**: create **custom charsets** and **transforms patterns** trough a simple **config file**.
+ **Interactive mode** and **one-line command interface** supported. 
+ Included in **<a href="https://blackarch.org/">BlackArch Linux</a>** pentesting distribution and **<a href="https://inventory.raw.pm/">Rawsec's Cybersecurity Inventory</a>** since August 2019.


### Built with

+ **Python 3** (secondary branch keeps Python 2.7 legacy support)
  + **requests**
  + **alive-progress**

### What's new

**2.4.5 RELEASED**: Progress bar with ETA implemented

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting started

### Installation

```
pip install bopscrk
```



*Alternatively, if you want to clone the repo from Github instead of install it from Pypi:*

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/r3nt0n/bopscrk
cd bopscrk
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Run interactive mode
```
bopscrk -i
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
```

  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -i, --interactive  interactive mode, the script will ask you about target
  -w                 words to combine comma-separated (non-interactive mode)
  --min              min length for the words to generate (default: 4)
  --max              max length for the words to generate (default: 32)
  -c, --case         enable case transformations
  -l, --leet         enable leet transformations
  -n                 max amount of words to combine each time (default: 2)
  -a , --artists     artists to search song lyrics (comma-separated)
  -o , --output      output file to save the wordlist (default: tmp.txt)
  -C , --config      specify config file to use (default: ./bopscrk.cfg)
  --version          print version and exit

```

_For more information, please refer to the [Advanced usage](#advanced-usage) section._

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### How it works
+ You have to **provide** some **words** which will act as a base.      
+ The **lyricpass feature** allow to introduce **artists**. The tool will download all his **songs' lyrics** and each line will be added as a new word. By default, artist names and a word formed by the initial of word on each phrase, will be added too.
+ The tool will generate **all possible combinations** between them.  
+ To generate more combinations, it will add some **common separators** (e.g. "-", "_", "."), **numbers** and **special chars** frequently used in passwords.
+ You can use **leet** and **case transforms** to increase your chances.  

[//]: # (+ You can provide **wordlists** that you have already tested against the target in order **to exclude** all this words from the resultant wordlist &#40;`-x`&#41;.)
  
### Tips  
+ Fields can be left **empty**.
+ You **can use accentuation** in your words and special chars (if you use the non-interactive mode, escape special chars like `'` and `"` with backslashes, e.g.: `bopscrk -w John,O\'hara,Doe,foo,bar`).
+ In the others field you can write **several words comma-separated**. *Example*: 2C,Flipper.
+ If you want to produce **all possible leet transformations**, enable the **recursive_leet option** in configuration file.
+ You can **select which transforms to apply on lyrics phrases** found through the **cfg file**.
+ Using the **non-interactive mode**, you should provide years in the long and short way (1970,70) to get the same result than the interactive mode.
+ You have to be careful with **-n** argument. If you set a big value, it could result in **too huge wordlists**. I recommend values between 2 and 5.
+ To provide **several artist names** through command line you should provide it **comma-separated**. *Example*: `-a johndoe,johnsmith`
+ To provide **artist names with spaces** through command line you should provide it **quotes-enclosed**. *Example*: `-a "john doe,john smith"`

### Lyricpass 
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/R3nt0n/bopscrk/blob/master/img/lyricpass_demo.png" /></p>  

This feature is based in a modified version of a [tool](https://github.com/initstring/lyricpass) developed originally by [initstring](https://github.com/initstring/). The changes are made to integrate input and output's tool with bopscrk.  

It will retrieve all lyrics from all songs which belongs to artists that you provide. **By default it will store each artist, each phrase found with space substitution, each phrase found reduced to its initials** (which will be transformed later if you have activated leet and case transforms).

### Advanced usage

#### Customizing behaviour using .cfg file
+ In `bopscrk.cfg` file you can specify your own charsets and enable/disable options:
  + **threads**: number of threads to use in multithreaded operations
  + **extra_combinations** (like `(john, doe) => 123john, john123, 123doe, doe123, john123doe doe123john`) are *enabled by default*. You can disable it in the configuration file in order to get more focused wordlists.  
  + **separators_chars**: characters to use in extra-combinations. *Can be a single char or a string of chars, e.g.: `!?-/&(`*  
  + **separators_strings**: strings  to use in extra-combinations. *Can be a single string or a list of strings space-separated, e.g.: `123` `34!@`*
  + **leet_charset**: characters to replace and correspondent substitute in leet transforms, *e.g.: `e:3 b:8 t:7 a:4`* 
  + **recursive_leet**: enables a recursive call to leet_transforms() function to get all possible leet transforms (*disabled by default*). *WARNING*: enabled with huge --max parameters (e.g.: greater than 18) could take even days. *Can be true or false.* 
  + **remove_parenthesis**: remove all parenthesis in lyrics found before any transform  
  + **take_initials**: produce words based on initial of each word in lyric phrases found (if enabled with remove_parenthesis disabled, it can produce useless words)
  + **artist_split_by_word**: split artist names and add each word as a new one 
  + **lyric_split_by_word**: same with lyrics found
  + **artist_space_replacement**: replace spaces in artist names with chars/strings defined in charset
  + **lyric_space_replacement**: same with lyrics found
  + **space_replacement_chars**: characters to insert instead of spaces inside an artist name or a lyric phrase.  *Can be a single char or a string of chars, e.g.: `!?-/&(`*
  + **space_replacement_strings**: strings to insert instead of spaces inside an artist name or a lyric phrase.  *Can be a single string or a list of strings space-separated, e.g.: `123` `34!@`*
+ Some transforms have **extensive charsets** preincluded. To use it instead of the basic ones, just **comment and uncomment** the corresponding lines (It's important to comment the original one, if you let two lines with the same keyname uncommented, it will throw an error: `AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'split'`).

+ **Parameters configuration examples**
  + Combine all the words using dots as separator, and same using commas  
    `separators_chars=.,` 
  + Convert all "a/A" occurrences into "4" and all "e/E" occurrences into "3"  
    `leet_charset=a:4 e:3`

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Improve **memory management**

- [ ] Improve **performance**
    - [ ] Refactor and improve threads and transforms logic
- [ ] Extra features
    - [x] Implement **progress bar** to keep user informed of the execution state
    - [ ] Implement **session file** to keep track of the execution point and **be able to stop and resume sessions** (<a href="https://github.com/r3nt0n/bopscrk/issues">#12</a>)
    - [ ] Create **config options** for customized **case transforms** (e.g.: disable pair/odd transforms)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/r3nt0n/bopscrk/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
